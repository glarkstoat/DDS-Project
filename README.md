# Setup the Project

Here is a quick step by step explanation how to set up the project so we can all work together on it:

1. Install KNIME and set the KNIME-Workspace to wherever you want.
2. Clone the Git-Hub Repository into the KNIME-Workspace. If you never used GitHub before I would recomend using GitHub Desktop for this. If you have questions just write me and I will help you.
3. Download the data from this [Link](https://www.dropbox.com/s/r1f53o4d4xtjudp/SHR76_20.csv?dl=1) and put it into the directory of the cloned Git Project.
4. Open the KNIME Project and try to execute the File Reader Node. 
5. Everything should be set up now.


Any questions write me on whatsApp or an email at tobias@lint.at

Cheers,
Tobi
